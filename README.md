# LLM-conext
## Problem
LLM and its tools have limited context window Size.
## Solution
I used Vector database to solve this Problem, whenever any tools gets a big response, it will store it in a vector database, and according to User's query , we can retirve it from vector database and give relevant conext to our tool, that can perform firther task.
